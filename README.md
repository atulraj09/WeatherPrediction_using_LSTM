Overview

This project demonstrates time-series forecasting using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model predicts hourly temperature data from a weather dataset and employs Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to optimize hyperparameters like hidden units and learning rate for improved accuracy.

Features

1.Time-series forecasting with an LSTM model.
2.Hyperparameter optimization using ABC.
3.RMSE-based evaluation and acceptance criteria.
4.Visualizations to analyze model performance and parameter sensitivity.
